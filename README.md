# Dummy-Variables-Examples

Two examples of two different ways are presented in the code. The first example is using a factor variable with three levels whereas in the second example two factor variables are included with three and two levels respectively. 
Multiplication of matrices and linear refression are shown in each of these cases.

The idea is to use:
1. #levels-1  + Intercept  for the regression analysis
OR
2. #levels  (WITHOUT Intercept) for the regression analysis. 
By having intercept and all the levels of the factor causes multicolinearity in the model.
